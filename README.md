Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is known for its platform independence, robustness, security, and multi-threading capabilities. At the heart of Java lies the principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software programs. This repository consists of basic object oriented programs to help understand its concept easier. This README provides an overview of OOP concepts in Java.

## Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data into a single unit.
## Object
An object is an instance of a class. It is created from a class and can use the methods defined in the class.
## Method
A method is a block of code or function that performs a specific task. Methods are defined within a class and can be used to operate on the data members of the class.
## Four Pillars of OOP
### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class are hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
### Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class. It provides the ability to create a new class from an existing class.
### Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms". It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.
  1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
  2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
### Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the internal details and showing only the functionality. It helps to reduce programming complexity and effort.
## Advantages of OOP
- #### Modularity:
  The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects.
- #### Reusability:
  Objects can be reused across programs.
- #### Pluggability and Debugging Ease:
  If a particular object turns out to be problematic, it can be removed and replaced with a different object.
- #### Inheritance:
  This allows for the creation of a new class from an existing class.
- #### Abstraction:
  Reduces complexity by hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality.
## Conclusion
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a crucial concept in Java that helps developers build modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Understanding and applying OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction can significantly enhance the quality and efficiency of your Java programs.
